By simulating\ndifferent retrieval and selection conditions through a controlled mixture of\ngold and distractor knowledge, we assess the impact of these factors on\ngeneration outcomes. Our findings indicate that the downstream generator\nmodel's capability, as well as the complexity of the task and dataset,\nsignificantly influence the impact of knowledge selection on the overall RAG\nsystem performance. In typical scenarios, improving the knowledge recall score\nis key to enhancing generation outcomes, with the knowledge selector providing\nlimited benefit when a strong generator model is used on clear, well-defined\ntasks.

We introduce the third and\nmore inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel\ncomputation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely\nparallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing\nparameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,\ndata, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it\nthrough large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel\nstreams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\\log P)$ while showing\nsuperior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\\times$\nless memory increase and 6$\\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter\nscaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an\noff-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training\non a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget.

However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also\nagree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an\nimportant mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws.

This defect is more obvious in Chinese\nscenarios. To demonstrate this flaw of LLMs, we construct an adversarial\ndataset, named as $\\textbf{ADT (Adversarial Dataset for Tokenizer)}$, which\ndraws upon the vocabularies of various open-source LLMs to challenge LLMs'\ntokenization.

Previous work has primarily focused on\ncontent repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition\nproblem in code generation.

To facilitate this study, we\nconstruct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches\nfor mitigating the repetition problems in code generation.

To provide accurate\nreward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct\ninterpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by\nrecent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we\nhypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward\nmodeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. To this\nend, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward\nModels (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We\npropose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs,\nRM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism -- self-generating\nsample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate\nresponses against them. The training of M-R1 consists of two key stages: (1)\ndistillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning\nwith verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much\nlarger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones\n(e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9%.

Traditional statistical\nmethods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex\ninteractions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each\ncrash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway\ncrash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226\ntraffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset\nencompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was\ncreated. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its\nunderstanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in\nthese studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash\ncausation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing\ncomprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable\nand aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively\nidentify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,\naggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as\nroad maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical\napplicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated\nby a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety,\nas reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the\ncomplex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive\nanalysis of crash causation and other contributing factors.

To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a\nnew framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework\nsupports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D\nrotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses\nthe generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes\nreal-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training\ndata pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a\nsingle trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames,\nwe incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this\nchallenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We\ndesign a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout\ntraining.

However,\ndiffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in\nreality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture\nartifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a\nsynthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic\nimages containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered\ninfeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered\nout-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a\nmodel's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be\nexcluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility\nreally matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is\nnecessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,\nfocusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We\nintroduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to\ninclude feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated\nby a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally\naffects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference\nin top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets.

This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The\nUniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both\nunified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore\nmetric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity.\nExperimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing\nbenchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing\ncurrent metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual\ngeneration models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.\n","authors":["Yi Li","Haonan Wang","Qixiang Zhang","Boyu Xiao","Chenchang Hu","Hualiang Wang","Xiaomeng Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10483v1.pdf","comment":"UniEval is the first evaluation framework designed for unified\n  multimodal models, including a holistic benchmark UniBench and the UniScore\n  metric"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10481v1","updated":"2025-05-15T16:31:49Z","published":"2025-05-15T16:31:49Z","title":"Logos as a Well-Tempered Pre-train for Sign Language Recognition","summary":"  This paper examines two aspects of the isolated sign language recognition\n(ISLR) task.

However, existing methods rely\nlargely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits\ngeneralization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video\nCrafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences\n(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT\n(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.\nCompared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust\nspatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image\nand character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we\nintroduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention\nwith 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as\n4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D\nworld. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new\ndirection for pose-guided human video generation.

Moreover, generic models often disrupt the overall\nartistic effect when modifying specific areas, making it more complicated to\nachieve a unified aesthetic in artworks.

However, adapting these models\nwith limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their\nability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal\nRepresentation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,\nmodality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected\ninto both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more\neffective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize\nclass token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder\nlayers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneral knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and\nrepresentation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is\napplied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection\nlayer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To\nfurther promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning\nclass and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features.

Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by\nadapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.\nDespite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing\nchallenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for\nALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer\nselection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select\nlow-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we\npropose an entropy-based consistency loss.

To tackle these issues, we propose a contour-aware and saliency\npriors embedding network (CSPENet) for ISTD. We first design a\nsurround-convergent prior extraction module (SCPEM) that effectively captures\nthe intrinsic characteristic of target contour pixel gradients converging\ntoward their center. This module concurrently extracts two collaborative\npriors: a boosted saliency prior for accurate target localization and\nmulti-scale structural priors for comprehensively enriching contour detail\nrepresentation.

In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,\nlabeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are\nused to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,\nparticularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As\na result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation\n(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and\nunlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA\nmethods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and\nself-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target\ndomain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images\nand pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.\nMoreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under\nlimited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to\naddress these challenges.

However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model.

Previous work has primarily focused on\ncontent repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition\nproblem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is\nstructural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in\nvarious patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently\nreflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition\nand propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for\nRepetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems\nin code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to\nidentify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically\ndecays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,\nthereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we\nconstruct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches\nfor mitigating the repetition problems in code generation.

Specifically, CoSine routes inference requests to specialized drafters\nbased on their expertise and incorporates a confidence-based token fusion\nmechanism to synthesize outputs from cooperating drafters, ensuring\nhigh-quality draft generation. Additionally, CoSine dynamically orchestrates\nthe execution of speculative decoding and verification in a pipelined manner,\nemploying batch scheduling to selectively group requests and adaptive\nspeculation control to minimize idle periods. By optimizing parallel workflows\nthrough heterogeneous node collaboration, CoSine balances draft generation and\nverification throughput in real-time, thereby maximizing resource utilization.\nExperimental results demonstrate that CoSine achieves superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art speculative approaches. Notably, with equivalent\nresource costs, CoSine achieves up to a 23.2% decrease in latency and a 32.5%\nincrease in throughput compared to baseline methods.\n","authors":["Luyao Gao","Jianchun Liu","Hongli Xu","Xichong Zhang","Yunming Liao","Liusheng Huang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10325v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10198v1","updated":"2025-05-15T11:55:16Z","published":"2025-05-15T11:55:16Z","title":"A multi-head deep fusion model for recognition of cattle foraging events\n  using sound and movement signals","summary":"  Monitoring feeding behaviour is a relevant task for efficient herd management\nand the effective use of available resources in grazing cattle.

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers.

In this paper, we\ndescribe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically\nfor the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance\nin an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance\nprocessor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and\nused them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a\nbase LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model\nincreased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we\ndeveloped an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This\nled us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an\ninstruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator\nrating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of\nnewer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude\nwith a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs\nusing exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.\n","authors":["Nicolas Dupuis","Ravi Nair","Shyam Ramji","Sean McClintock","Nishant Chauhan","Priyanka Nagpal","Bart Blaner","Ken Valk","Leon Stok","Ruchir Puri"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09610v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21696v2","updated":"2025-05-14T17:48:02Z","published":"2025-03-27T17:00:51Z","title":"Embodied-Reasoner: Synergizing Visual Search, Reasoning, and Action for\n  Embodied Interactive Tasks","summary":"  Recent advances in deep thinking models have demonstrated remarkable\nreasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks.

The Qwen3 series\nincludes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with\nparameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is\nthe integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and\nnon-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified\nframework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as\nchat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g.,\nQwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat\ntemplates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing\nusers to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby\nbalancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by\nleveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the\ncomputational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring\ntheir highly competitive performance.

Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher\nlogits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the\ncontext prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual\nentrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the\nrelevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the\nsentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of\ncontextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual\nprompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while\ncontextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic\nfactors.\n  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment\nheads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a\nnovel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we\nidentify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads,\ni.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is\nsignificantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates\nto what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery\nof contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via\nthe entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and\nmitigation of the distraction problem.\n","authors":["Jingcheng Niu","Xingdi Yuan","Tong Wang","Hamidreza Saghir","Amir H.

While previous studies have\npredominantly relied on linear methods to detect jailbreak attempts and model\nrefusals, we take a different approach by examining both linear and non-linear\nfeatures in prompts that lead to successful jailbreaks. First, we introduce a\nnovel dataset comprising 10,800 jailbreak attempts spanning 35 diverse attack\nmethods. Leveraging this dataset, we train probes to classify successful from\nunsuccessful jailbreaks using the latent representations corresponding to\nprompt tokens. Notably, we find that even when probes achieve high accuracy in\npredicting the success of jailbreaks, their performance often fails to\ngeneralize to unseen attack methods. This reveals that different jailbreaking\nstrategies exploit different non-linear, non-universal features. Next, we\ndemonstrate that non-linear probes provide a powerful tool for steering model\nbehavior. Specifically, we use these probes to guide targeted latent space\nperturbations, enabling us to effectively modulate the model's robustness\nagainst jailbreaks.

While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes.

However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g.\nin form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically\nplausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces\nand exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current\nstate-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict\ntorques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e.\nthe joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical\nmodels, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive\npreprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end,\nwe propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with\nthe kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural\nKalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to\npredict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a\nphysics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to\nrealize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and\nsimulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show\nthat this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps\nbalancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important\nfor not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing\nphysically plausible human poses.

Given the dilemma, how can\nwe design a practical system that meets user needs? Our current work at Airbnb\nprovides an answer, with a working solution deployed at scale. We start with\npairwise learning-to-rank (LTR) models-the bedrock of search ranking tech\nstacks today.

They are\nat a sweet spot of performance vs. cost, making them an ideal choice for\nseveral industrial applications.

However, to the\nbest of our knowledge, there is no fact-checking dataset at the ecosystem\nlevel, covering claims from a sufficiently long period of time and sourced from\na wide range of actors reflecting the entire ecosystem that admittedly follows\nwidely-accepted codes and principles of fact-checking. We present a new dataset\nFACTors, the first to fill this gap by presenting ecosystem-level data on\nfact-checking. It contains 118,112 claims from 117,993 fact-checking reports in\nEnglish (co-)authored by 1,953 individuals and published during the period of\n1995-2025 by 39 fact-checking organisations that are active signatories of the\nIFCN (International Fact-Checking Network) and/or EFCSN (European Fact-Checking\nStandards Network). It contains 7,327 overlapping claims investigated by\nmultiple fact-checking organisations, corresponding to 2,977 unique claims. It\nallows to conduct new ecosystem-level studies of the fact-checkers\n(organisations and individuals). To demonstrate the usefulness of FACTors, we\npresent three example applications, including a first-of-its-kind statistical\nanalysis of the fact-checking ecosystem, examining the political inclinations\nof the fact-checking organisations, and attempting to assign a credibility\nscore to each organisation based on the findings of the statistical analysis\nand political leanings. Our methods for constructing FACTors are generic and\ncan be used to maintain a live dataset that can be updated dynamically.\n","authors":["Enes Altuncu","Can Başkent","Sanjay Bhattacherjee","Shujun Li","Dwaipayan Roy"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09414v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted for the 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research\n  and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR '25)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09364v1","updated":"2025-05-14T13:13:53Z","published":"2025-05-14T13:13:53Z","title":"Diffusion Recommender Models and the Illusion of Progress: A Concerning\n  Study of Reproducibility and a Conceptual Mismatch","summary":"  Countless new machine learning models are published every year and are\nreported to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in \\emph{top-n}\nrecommendation.

QoE of YouTube\nreflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift\nevents. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is\nfrequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts\nensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion\nscore. For instance, dropping from 1080p to 480p during a video can preserve\ncontinuity but might reduce the viewers enjoyment. Over time, OTT platforms are\nlooking for alternative ways to boost user experience instead of relying on\ntraditional Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and\nthroughput. As a result, we look into the relationship between quality shifting\nin YouTube streaming sessions and the channel metrics RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. Our\nfindings state that these channel metrics positively correlate with shifts.\nThus, in real-time, OTT can only rely on them to predict video streaming\nsessions into lower- and higher-resolution categories, thus providing more\nresources to improve user experience. Using traditional Machine Learning (ML)\nclassifiers, we achieved an accuracy of 77-percent, while using only RSRP,\nRSRQ, and SNR.

In this paper, we propose an effective method called Deep Interest\nLife-cycle Network (DILN), which not only captures the interest life-cycle\nfeatures efficiently, but can also be easily integrated to existing ranking\nmodels.

The method centers on multi-hop paths composed of various types of\nentities and relations. It models user preferences through three stages: path\nselection, semantic representation, and attention-based fusion. In the path\nselection stage, a path filtering mechanism is introduced to remove redundant\nand noisy information. In the representation learning stage, a sequential\nmodeling structure is used to jointly encode entities and relations, preserving\nthe semantic dependencies within paths. In the fusion stage, an attention\nmechanism assigns different weights to each path to generate a global user\ninterest representation. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets such as\nAmazon-Book show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing\nrecommendation models across multiple evaluation metrics, including HR@10,\nRecall@10, and Precision@10. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-hop\npaths in capturing high-order interaction semantics and demonstrate the\nexpressive modeling capabilities of the framework in heterogeneous\nrecommendation scenarios. This method provides both theoretical and practical\nvalue by integrating structural information modeling in heterogeneous networks\nwith recommendation algorithm design. It offers a more expressive and flexible\nparadigm for learning user preferences in complex data environments.\n","authors":["Hongye Zheng","Yue Xing","Lipeng Zhu","Xu Han","Junliang Du","Wanyu Cui"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05989v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04938v2","updated":"2025-05-09T11:41:16Z","published":"2025-05-08T04:27:11Z","title":"FF-PNet: A Pyramid Network Based on Feature and Field for Brain Image\n  Registration","summary":"  In recent years, deformable medical image registration techniques have made\nsignificant progress. However, existing models still lack efficiency in\nparallel extraction of coarse and fine-grained features. To address this, we\nconstruct a new pyramid registration network based on feature and deformation\nfield (FF-PNet). For coarse-grained feature extraction, we design a Residual\nFeature Fusion Module (RFFM), for fine-grained image deformation, we propose a\nResidual Deformation Field Fusion Module (RDFFM). Through the parallel\noperation of these two modules, the model can effectively handle complex image\ndeformations. It is worth emphasizing that the encoding stage of FF-PNet only\nemploys traditional convolutional neural networks without any attention\nmechanisms or multilayer perceptrons, yet it still achieves remarkable\nimprovements in registration accuracy, fully demonstrating the superior feature\ndecoding capabilities of RFFM and RDFFM.

Efficient\nvector search requires deep optimizations in database systems. This has\nmotivated a new class of specialized vector databases that optimize for vector\nsearch quality and cost. Instead, we argue that a scalable, high-performance,\nand cost-efficient vector search system can be built inside a cloud-native\noperational database like Azure Cosmos DB while leveraging the benefits of a\ndistributed database such as high availability, durability, and scale. We do\nthis by deeply integrating DiskANN, a state-of-the-art vector indexing library,\ninside Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL. This system uses a single vector index per\npartition stored in existing index trees, and kept in sync with underlying\ndata. It supports < 20ms query latency over an index spanning 10 million of\nvectors, has stable recall over updates, and offers nearly 15x and 41x lower\nquery cost compared to Zilliz and Pinecone serverless enterprise products. It\nalso scales out to billions of vectors via automatic partitioning. This\nconvergent design presents a point in favor of integrating vector indices into\noperational databases in the context of recent debates on specialized vector\ndatabases, and offers a template for vector indexing in other databases.\n","authors":["Nitish Upreti","Krishnan Sundaram","Hari Sudan Sundar","Samer Boshra","Balachandar Perumalswamy","Shivam Atri","Martin Chisholm","Revti Raman Singh","Greg Yang","Subramanyam Pattipaka","Tamara Hass","Nitesh Dudhey","James Codella","Mark Hildebrand","Magdalen Manohar","Jack Moffitt","Haiyang Xu","Naren Datha","Suryansh Gupta","Ravishankar Krishnaswamy","Prashant Gupta","Abhishek Sahu","Ritika Mor","Santosh Kulkarni","Hemeswari Varada","Sudhanshu Barthwal","Amar Sagare","Dinesh Billa","Zishan Fu","Neil Deshpande","Shaun Cooper","Kevin Pilch","Simon Moreno","Aayush Kataria","Vipul Vishal","Harsha Vardhan Simhadri"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05885v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06324v1","updated":"2025-05-09T04:40:11Z","published":"2025-05-09T04:40:11Z","title":"Document Attribution: Examining Citation Relationships using Large\n  Language Models","summary":"  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to document-based\ntasks - such as document summarization, question answering, and information\nextraction - where user requirements focus on retrieving information from\nprovided documents rather than relying on the model's parametric knowledge,\nensuring the trustworthiness and interpretability of these systems has become a\ncritical concern. A central approach to addressing this challenge is\nattribution, which involves tracing the generated outputs back to their source\ndocuments.

The lack of data on\nnationality can create challenges for migration research. It can lead to a\nleft-censoring issue since we are uncertain about the migrant's country of\norigin. Once we observe an emigration event, if we know the nationality, we can\ndifferentiate it from return migration. We propose methods to detect the\nnationality with the least available data, i.e., full names. We use the\ndetected nationality in comparison with the country of academic origin, which\nis a common approach in studying the migration of researchers. We gathered 2.6\nmillion unique name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and categorized them into\nfamilies of nationalities with three granularity levels to use as our training\ndata. Using a character-based machine learning model, we achieved a weighted F1\nscore of 84% for the broadest and 67% for the most granular, country-level\ncategorization. In our empirical study, we used the trained and tested model to\nassign nationality to 8+ million scholars' full names in Scopus data. Our\nresults show that using the country of first publication as a proxy for\nnationality underestimates the size of return flows, especially for countries\nwith a more diverse academic workforce, such as the USA, Australia, and Canada.\nWe found that around 48% of emigration from the USA was return migration once\nwe used the country of name origin, in contrast to 33% based on academic\norigin. In the most recent period, 79% of scholars whose affiliation has\nconsistently changed from the USA to China, and are considered emigrants, have\nChinese names in contrast to 41% with a Chinese academic origin.

We gather 401,403 preference judgements from 4,835\nparticipants across 10 countries, systematically sampling two-dimensional\nparameter spaces for each modality. The findings reveal both universal patterns\nand cultural variations. Preferences for shape and curvature cross-culturally\ndemonstrate a consistent preference for symmetrical forms. While colour\npreferences are categorically consistent, ratio-like preferences vary across\ncultures. Musical harmony shows strong agreement in interval relationships\ndespite differing regions of preference within the broad frequency spectrum,\nwhile melody shows the highest cross-cultural variation. These results suggest\nthat aesthetic preferences emerge from an interplay between shared perceptual\nmechanisms and cultural learning.\n","authors":["Harin Lee","Eline Van Geert","Elif Celen","Raja Marjieh","Pol van Rijn","Minsu Park","Nori Jacoby"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14439v2.pdf","comment":"To be presented at CogSci 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03568v3","updated":"2025-05-09T08:19:45Z","published":"2023-05-05T14:19:46Z","title":"A vector quantized masked autoencoder for audiovisual speech emotion\n  recognition","summary":"  An important challenge in emotion recognition is to develop methods that can\nleverage unlabeled training data. In this paper, we propose the VQ-MAE-AV\nmodel, a self-supervised multimodal model that leverages masked autoencoders to\nlearn representations of audiovisual speech without labels. The model includes\nvector quantized variational autoencoders that compress raw audio and visual\nspeech data into discrete tokens. The audiovisual speech tokens are used to\ntrain a multimodal masked autoencoder that consists of an encoder-decoder\narchitecture with attention mechanisms. The model is designed to extract both\nlocal (i.e., at the frame level) and global (i.e., at the sequence level)\nrepresentations of audiovisual speech. During self-supervised pre-training, the\nVQ-MAE-AV model is trained on a large-scale unlabeled dataset of audiovisual\nspeech, for the task of reconstructing randomly masked audiovisual speech\ntokens and with a contrastive learning strategy. During this pre-training, the\nencoder learns to extract a representation of audiovisual speech that can be\nsubsequently leveraged for emotion recognition. During the supervised\nfine-tuning stage, a small classification model is trained on top of the\nVQ-MAE-AV encoder for an emotion recognition task.

However, the cost behind\ntraining such sophisticated models is resource intensive, resulting in many to\nconsider DNNs to be intellectual property (IP) to model owners. In this era of\ncloud computing, high-performance DNNs are often deployed all over the internet\nso that people can access them publicly. As such, DNN watermarking schemes,\nespecially backdoor-based watermarks, have been actively developed in recent\nyears to preserve proprietary rights. Nonetheless, there lies much uncertainty\non the robustness of existing backdoor watermark schemes, towards both\nadversarial attacks and unintended means such as fine-tuning neural network\nmodels. One reason for this is that no complete guarantee of robustness can be\nassured in the context of backdoor-based watermark.

Our empirical results show that by solely introducing training\ndata after fine-tuning, the watermark can be restored if model parameters do\nnot shift dramatically during fine-tuning. Depending on the types of trigger\nsamples used, trigger accuracy can be reinstated to up to 100%. Our study\nfurther explores how the restoration process works using loss landscape\nvisualization, as well as the idea of introducing training data in fine-tuning\nstage to alleviate watermark vanishing.\n","authors":["Anh Tu Ngo","Chuan Song Heng","Nandish Chattopadhyay","Anupam Chattopadhyay"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02704v3.pdf","comment":"Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems\n  (TNNLS)"}]}}
